# To-Do-List-App
The To-do List project is a web application built with HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.
It records your daily task and to-do lists. You will add a task
for a specific time, edit it, and even mark it as
complete as your need. Also, you can simply delete any
one of the tasks from the list.
